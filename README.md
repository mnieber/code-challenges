# code-challenges

This is a repository that contains several code-challenges I took:

- cashcog (React app for approving expense declarations, based on expense events collected by a back-end)
- linespeed (React app that shows boxplots of speed measurements collected in the back-end)
- starwars (React app that shows a list of starwars characters downloaded via GraphQL)
